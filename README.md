# lsd
## A Cheap Psychedelic Simulator on Linux


### How To
1. Simply clone the repository, and run the shell script (on Bash (currently))
2. If you want to run this from anywhere, make a binary of this script (using `shc`), add the path to your PATH variable, et voila!

### Arch User Repository
lsd is also available on the AUR, here. You can get the (also) PKGBUILD from there, and install it using your favorite AUR helper.
